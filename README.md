# 🛍️ Kaggle Customer Behavior Analysis

Welcome to my data science project that explores and decodes consumer behavior using a rich, multi-dimensional dataset from Kaggle. This project applies data cleaning, exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling techniques to derive actionable insights for marketers and businesses.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Analyze consumer purchase patterns and demographics
- Segment customers using unsupervised learning
- Predict customer satisfaction and purchase intent
- Identify key drivers of loyalty and retention
- Derive business insights to guide marketing and sales strategies

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes detailed information such as:

- **Demographics** (age, gender, income, marital status)
- **Purchase behavior** (amount, frequency, channel, category)
- **Customer sentiment** (ratings, satisfaction, returns)
- **Decision-making patterns** (time to decision, product research time)
- **Marketing influences** (ad engagement, social media, discounts)
